          <p><strong>Note:</strong> In December 2011, the UCR Program changed its SRS definition of rape: "Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The effect of this definition change is not seen in reported crime data until after January 2013. Data reported from prior years has not been revised.</p>
