        <h1>Crime in Berkeley, CA</h1>
        <p>Run by the FBI, the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program defines eight crimes as Part I offenses: criminal homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny (excluding motor vehicle theft), motor vehicle theft, and arson.</p>
        <p><a href="https://data.cityofberkeley.info/Public-Safety/Berkeley-PD-UCR-Annual-Part-I-Crimes/efkp-2py4/data">Data from the City of Berkeley Open Data portal</a> shows the annual totals of UCR Part I crimes, except for arson, reported to the Berkeley Police Department since 1985. The official description of the dataset can be found on the <a href="https://data.cityofberkeley.info/Public-Safety/Berkeley-PD-UCR-Annual-Part-I-Crimes/efkp-2py4">portal website</a>. The crime definitions stated below are as defined by the UCR Program on the <a href="https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/offenses.cfm">UCR program website</a>.</p>

        <p>Deaths caused by negligence, attempts to kill, assaults to kill, suicides, and accidental deaths are excluded. Justifiable homicides are classified separately.</p>
        <p><strong>Manslaughter by negligence:</strong> the killing of another person through gross negligence.</p>

        <h2>Forcible Rape</h2>
        <p>The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will. Rapes by force and attempts or assaults to rape, regardless of the age of the victim, are included.</p>
        <p>Statutory offenses (no force used and victim under age of consent) are excluded.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> In December 2011, the UCR Program changed its SRS definition of rape: "Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The effect of this definition change is not seen in reported crime data until after January 2013. Data reported from prior years has not been revised.</p>
